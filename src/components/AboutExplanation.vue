        <h2>About this tool</h2>
        <div>
          Rebel Write is a tool to <strong>help you write guides</strong> for
          activists. It is powered by
          <strong>artifical intelligence (AI)</strong>. In other words: a
          computer writes the text it produces.

          Our AI is quite smart, but not human. It will makes mistakes, so be
          careful when using it.
          <strong>Not everything our tool says it factually true.</strong>
          You need to do your own research.

          This tool is not meant to replace human writers. Do not copy & paste
          the text it produces.
          <strong>Use it to brainstorm and get inspiration</strong> about the
          topic you want to write about.
